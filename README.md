# SanityCheck

This is a work in progress. This script checks for basic stuff when sending code to a repo or putting code on a staging or production server. Things this script is checking include:

* Permissions
* Ownership
* localhost possible links
* local IP address possible links.

Help make it better. All feedback is welcome. 

Enjoy!
