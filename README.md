# SanityCheck

This is a work in progress. This script checks for basic stuff when sending code to a repo or putting code on a staging or production server. Things this script is checking include:

* Permissions
* Ownership
* localhost possible links
* local IP address possible links.

Usage:
* Downlaad the script
* <code>Chmod +x SanityCheck.sh</code>
* <code>./SanityCheck.sh</code>
* Enter the absolute path to your site (ex: /var/www/mysite/public_html)

Help make it better. All feedback is welcome. 

Enjoy!
